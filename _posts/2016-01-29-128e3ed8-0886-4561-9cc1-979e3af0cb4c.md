We've been building tools for social media marketing for quite a while. It came to us as a surprise that you could use many great fake follower checking tools for Twitter, like [TwitterAudit][0], but there was none for Instagram. The reason behind this is that the public Twitter API is much more permissive than Instagram's.

After some hacking by [Cusna][1]we figured out a way to do it, at least partially. With a sample of 150 followers from any account, we tried to identify some traits that could tell you that a follower is false:

* Dodgy links and keywords in the bio (GET 100 FREE FOLLOWERS FAST!).
* Poor ratio of following to followers (we understand this will bring many false positives, but if someone has 10 followers and follows 4000 people... something's weird).
* No pictures posted (again, there may be people who are just lurking, but it's not the norm).

Taking this into account, we created [Instacheck][2]. It's just an approximation, but if someone has bought 10000 followers... you will probably be able to tell.

If you have any idea on how to improve the algorithm, please send it to[cusna][3]along with a kitten picture.
